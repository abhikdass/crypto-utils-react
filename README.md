# Crypto Utils React

A web-based application for encoding/decoding, hashing, and encryption/decryption utilities. This project is built using React, with support for AES, DES, Base64, Hex, and other cryptographic and encoding methods.

## Features

- **Encryption/Decryption**: Supports AES and DES in multiple modes (CBC, ECB) with key and IV input options.
- **Hashing**: Hash your input using SHA-256, SHA-1, or MD5.
- **Encoding/Decoding**: Convert between UTF, Base64, Hex, and Binary formats.

## Usage

Once you run the app, you can access different functionalities via the homepage. There are three main sections:

1. **Encryption/Decryption**: Input the text, select the algorithm, key format, and optional IV.
2. **Hashes**: Generate a hash from your input using different hashing algorithms.
3. **Encoding/Decoding**: Easily convert your data between different formats like Base64, Hex, UTF, and Binary.
